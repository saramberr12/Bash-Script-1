# description 	:This script will parse file1.txt, send its base64 decoded data to a temporary file, 
#		 parse the decoded data for specific line numbers including specific string lines,
#		 remove anything that comes before and including the first sought out string
#		 remove anything that comes after and including the second sought out string,
#		 sends the resulting data to a new output file, and then stout's to the user the
#		 md5 and sha1 hashed data.
